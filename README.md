# Stocker

<h3>Intro</h3>
Stocker is a real-time hybrid (web, iOS, Android) application that was created at the _HACK_A_TON_ SF (hack-a-ton.com/sf) event sponsored by Ionic, Firebase, Auth0, and Socket.io on February 7, 2015. In short, Stocker is a "Tinder" for Stocks. Swipe right to place a bet, swipe left to pass, with real-time data graphs that show the flucation of stocks. The Stocker team consisted of five members including Wesley Pascual, Carroll Yu, Antoine Lefebvre, SÃ©bastien Tessot, Jaime Kornick. It was the second place winner of the hackathon.
