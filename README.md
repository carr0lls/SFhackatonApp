# Stocker
Stocker is a real-time hybrid (web, iOS, Android) application that was created at the [_HACK_A_TON_SF](http://hack-a-ton.com/sf) event sponsored by [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/), [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) on February 7, 2015. In short, Stocker is a "Tinder" for Stocks. Swipe right to place a bet, swipe left to pass, with real-time data graphs that show the flucation of stocks. The Stocker team consisted of five members including [Carroll Yu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrollyu), [Wesley Pascual](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seewes), Antoine Lefebvre, SÃ©bastien Tessot, Jaime Kornick. It was the second place winner of the hackathon.
